Spawn 2 small roshlings for every 15% hp lost

Wave10 - Leshrac
>50%hp mostly the same, except lighning is now point target and not unit target so the bolts are dodgeable

<50%hp
stun is recast a few times, acting as a cone

Boulder Roll -> Rolls 400 units forward at 600 speed

Boss12 - Ogres

12a
Ogre Magi - Spawns baby ogres and grants global buffs, tries to avoid combat unless attacked; if attacked can cas fireball and ignite (ignite would work like lsa and fireball is a linear projectile)

Baby Oges - Fodder, no abilities

12b:
Troll Warlord - mostly unchanged

boss13 - Trees

Furions - Only spawns treants

Treants - Purely fodder


round17 - skellington man

Wraith King: Has AOE wraithfire blast (linear projectiles ofc), upon death will turn into a tombstone that needs to be attacked 16 times in 10 seconds or he'll resurrect, can spawn Clinkz and big skeletons
can no longer turn himself magic immune
Clinkz - Same as before, but focus fire is changed to be like Sylph's rapid fire, instead of boosting attackspeed will send a flurry of linear projectiles towards the target point (no spread)
Skeleton Heavy - Can stomp the ground around them, radius decreased significantly, no longer spawn mini skeletons

round20 - Warlock golem

Hellkeeper: Removed, is the same as warlock just without having to be spawned in or the meteor

Warlock: Same as before, but can cast some actual spells holy shit i know
can curse the ground, making anyone that stands in it take damage, can channel upheaval, but his upheaval deals minor damage as well as a slow (tries to combo curse + upheaval)
Warlock Golem, mostly the same; but this time the heal disable meteor is a dodgeable ability and the fire wave no longer instakills you, just deal massive damage and also disables healing


round22 - necro wave
mosly unchanged but change spaghetti code and let necro teleport during death bubble

round23 - doom wave
mostly unchanged but the fire storm instakill tornadoes are dodgeable, the doom razes are also progressively harder as he loses health

round24 - evil core
evil core no longer spawns stuff in, instead just casts some random bullshit like unstable elites and every cast removes mana; same rules apply; at 0 mana will be vulnerable
asura mostly unchanged, maybe add some more abilities/hell on earth patterns

round25 - broodmama
broodmama webs are permanent, but can be destroyed (needs 5 hits), broodmama will focus whoever is attacking her web if she's in it
eggs no longer take damage, instead take a constant 8 hits or need to be walked on for an instakill; broodmama will focus whoever's attacking her eggs if any are nearby
broodmama can now spit spawn spiderlings, creating baby spiderlings (the ones mini broodmamas make) if they hit any unit (does no damage by itself but slows)

round26 - time/space

Aeon: Mostly unchanged, just better warning signs and particles

Aeher: Mostly unchanged, but actually does damage now



All of these to lua
