KEYWORDS
======================

Armor
----------------------
Reduces the damage taken from physical attacks. Every point of Armor

Tenacity
----------------------
Decreases the effects of debuffs on heroes. Does not apply to debuffs that only deal damage. Stacks additively but is soft-capped at 50% (further increases have lowered efficiency)
Slows: Have their strength decreased, duration unchanged
Stuns: Have a chance to be ignored, duration is unchanged if the check fails.
Other: Duration is reduced by the amount of status resistance.

Swiftness
----------------------
Increases the movement speed of heroes.

Tempo
----------------------
Increases the rate of attack of heroes. Hard-capped at 1000

Spell Haste
----------------------
Reduces the cooldowns and cast time of abilities. Every source of cooldown reduction stacks additively.

Ability Power
----------------------
Increases spell scaling of abilities, the amount of bonus scaling provided is ability-specific and mentioned on the tooltip.
EXAMPLE: Punish (Guardian) - [ ] Deals 150 (+50% AP) damage, reduces armor by 5 (+10% AP) and all elemental armor by 3 (+10% AP)

Greed
----------------------
When you gain gold or experience from loot (non-passively), you gain a bonus amount based on your loot chance. 10% loot chance = +10% xp/gold. Thus

Certainty
----------------------
Increases the odds of dice rolls going in your favour. Additively adds to the chance.
EXAMPLE: 25% Bash chance + 10% luck => +35% Bash chance

Resilience
----------------------
Reduces damage from all sources inflicted on you.

Intensity
----------------------
Increases damage dealt from all sources by you.

Stun
----------------------
Completely disables minions. Champions and Bosses instead have their cast points and turn rate increased, as well as reducing their attack and movement speed to the lowest possible value.

Slow
----------------------
Reduces movement speed.

Silence
----------------------
Prevents non-right click like abilities from being cast. A boss ability called Swipe that functionally acts as an auto-attack but in an area of effect would not be disabled.

Disarm
--------------------
Prevents right-clicks and casting right-click like abilities.

Chill
----------------------
Stacks up to 100, slows enemy movement speed by 1% per stack of Chill. At 100, will freeze the enemy.

Freeze
----------------------
Functionally equivalent to a stun, but freezes animations as well. Enemies that are Frozen cannot be Chilled.

Paralyze
----------------------
100% movement and attack slow, generally short duration, unaffected by status resistance

Barrier
----------------------
Prevents all damage before reductions. Degrades by 10% of the current value per second.

Blind
----------------------
Causes the enemy to miss on attack.

Resilience
----------------------
Reduces all types of damage.

Signature
----------------------
An ability that functionally works as an auto-attack and whose cooldown is linked to your attack rate, leveled upon spawn

Innate
----------------------
Passive ability that is leveled upon spawn

Skill Trees
----------------------
Improve your hero and his abilities. Skill point cost is equal to the tier. 
You need at least one skill in the previous tier to skill something in the next one, but that does not stop you from taking everything in the previous tier.
Some talents require specific other talents to be skilled.

Items
----------------------
You start with the initial lv1 gear, you can purchase the next levels with gold, improving your base equipment
